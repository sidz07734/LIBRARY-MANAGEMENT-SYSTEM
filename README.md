## Technologies Used

### Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The frontend of this project is crafted using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**:
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** forms the structure of the web pages, providing the essential framework and content organization.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used for styling the HTML elements, ensuring the design is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages, enabling features like real-time updates, form validation, and user interactions.

### Backend: Python
The backend is implemented using **Python**, a high-level language known for its clean syntax and efficiency in server-side development. Python manages the logic, processes requests from the frontend, and handles data flow between the application and the database.
